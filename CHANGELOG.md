# Changelog

## [0.10.10] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- **VO2 evidence foundation** - Completed workouts can persist local
  `vo2_evidence`: pause-safe active duration, phase boundaries, work-end /
  cooldown markers (including Early Cooldown), HR acquisition facts, and
  machine provenance. Evidence only; no VO2 calculation, workout, or UI.
  Historical workouts without evidence remain unchanged. Evidence is stripped
  from SISU server ingest. See `VO2-EVIDENCE-FOUNDATION.md`.

## [0.10.9] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- **Fitbaus Bike Bridge client** - Settings -> Equipment can store a LAN bridge
  URL and optional automatic resistance control. Native Capacitor HTTP polls
  `/api/v1/status` and `/api/v1/telemetry` once per second and posts absolute
  `/api/v1/resistance` targets from existing machine guidance. Observed bike
  resistance, RPM, and watts stay independent of requested/desired values.

### Fixed

- **Bike bridge resistance range** - ProForm physical levels 1-15 are posted
  unchanged. The client no longer clamps 11-15 down to 10. Android cleartext
  documentation no longer claims Network Security Config is limited to the
  Fitbaus host; SISU ingest remains HTTPS-only in application code.

## [0.10.8] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- **Controller decision audit** - Local workout summaries can include a bounded
  `machine_decision_audit` of work-phase scheduling, HOLD/increase/decrease
  evaluations, and insufficient-HR deferrals without changing live guidance.

### Fixed

- **In-workout portrait height** - Pause, phase, machine card, and ring no
  longer push the heart and machine icons below the viewport on short phones.
  Leftover portrait height is distributed between those blocks so the stack is
  not packed at the top on taller phones. The ring sits above the heart and
  activity icons instead of overlapping them. The gray workout card fills the
  phone height and sits just above the warm-up / workout duration line. The
  start / pause row sits halfway between the day dropdown and the phase bar.

## [0.10.7] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- **Machine diagnostics export** - Settings -> Equipment can export an on-device
  machine-learning diagnostics snapshot, including timing evidence without
  inventing concrete evaluation times from phase duration alone.

### Fixed

- **Workout JSON download** - Download JSON from the workout list and summary
  modal uses in-memory summary data so the browser keeps the user gesture.
- **Modal overlay stacking** - Dialog overlays use a higher z-index so they sit
  above the hamburger / chrome UI.
- **Native system bars** - System bars stay hidden after app resume on native
  builds.

## [0.10.6] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Shadow resistance prediction** - Shadow-only resistance / HR predictions for
  machine guidance (no live resistance control changes).
- **Shadow prediction validation** - High-confidence validation of frozen ±1
  shadow predictions with a processed-session ledger.

### Fixed

- **Shadow HR levels** - Shadow HR estimates use effective / achievable
  resistance levels for hypothetical steps.

## [0.10.5] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **HR response reliability** - Track observable response windows versus
  detected onsets (lifetime and recent bounded opportunity history).
- **Trusted earlier timing** - Medium / long evaluation waits may shorten when
  recent high-confidence opportunity history allows; short-interval timing
  defaults are unchanged.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Machine HR dynamics learning** - Learn heart-rate response delay and delta
  after work starts and after ±1 resistance steps.
- **Personalized evaluation timing** - Medium / long evaluation waits use
  trusted delay medians from learned dynamics.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Learned starting resistance** - Learn starting resistance per
  machine / activity / intent / duration class from qualifying completed
  sessions.

### Fixed

- **Late-work HR gate** - Learned starts train only when late-work HR is within
  target (±3 bpm).

## [0.10.2] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Machine-aware workout guidance** - Resistance / cadence guidance semantics
  for profiled machines (rolling-median HR gates, short-interval finalize,
  recovery cadence at 63 RPM).
- **Runtime activity selection** - Choose workout activity at start when a plan
  allows more than one.

### Changed

- **Short-interval adaptation** - Evaluate only with usable HR near the end of
  the repetition; finalize next-rep adaptation at the work-phase boundary when
  the last in-phase tick is missed.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- **Machine profiling** - Equipment profiles and ProForm SMART Power 10
  resistance / cadence guidance with equipment selection and voice prompts.
- **Short-interval adaptation** - Adapt short-interval reps from evaluable HR
  near the end of the work phase.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- **Capacitor 8 native apps** - Android and iOS shells with community plugins
  for Bluetooth LE, Keep Awake, and text-to-speech. Native builds use
  `CapacitorHttp` for SISU `/health` and `/workout/ingest`; the hosted PWA path
  (Web Bluetooth, browser speech, Screen Wake Lock, service worker) is
  unchanged. See [NATIVE-DEVELOPMENT.md](NATIVE-DEVELOPMENT.md).
